# Directory Listing for Examples

When the SPI flash memory is compatible, the flash will ignore pins /WP and
/HOLD (GPIO pins 9 and 10). Allowing each GPIO pin's reassignment on ESP-12F
modules, NodeMCU DEV boards, and other modules that expose those pins.

## [Analyze](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/Analyze)

Evaluate the Flash memory for required attributes. Reports if the current code
supports the device as is. Prints a copy/paste block for creating a
`CustomVender.ino` file like that shown in the example
[OutlineCustom](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/OutlineCustom).
In OutlineCustom, `CustomVender.ino` is a merged collection of examples.


## [Outline](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/Outline)

An outline example demonstrating the use of `reclaim_GPIO_9_10()`, which can
handle more of the less conforming flash memories. Like GigaDevice GD25QxxC,
GD25QxxE, and EON EN25Q32C.

It shows using a global build conditional `RECLAIM_GPIO_EARLY` to control
reclaiming GPIOs from `preinit()` or `setup()`.

The hope is this will handle a large percentage of the modules that expose GPIO9
and 10.


## [OutlineCustom](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/OutlineCustom)

Similar to "Outline" above. Illustrates adding support for an additional Flash
part. Provides a hypothetical custom handler in `CustomVendor.ino` for
`spi_flash_vendor_cases()`.


## [OutlineXMC](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/OutlineXMC)

Similar to "OutlineCustom" above. Shows using the example code generated by
Analyze.ino to handle flash parts with individual part revision differences.
Illustrates the use of SFDP data for tailoring flash initialization for each
revision. Provides an untested hypothetical custom handler in `CustomXMC.ino`
for `spi_flash_vendor_cases()`. Reclaims GPIO9 and GPIO10 from `preinit()`.


## [OutlineEON](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/OutlineEON)

Similar to "OutlineCustom" above. Demonstrates extending the example code
generated by Analyze to handle a specific flash part EN25Q32C.  This example
illustrates the use of SFDP data. It provides a custom handler for EN25Q32C in
`CustomEON.ino` for `spi_flash_vendor_cases()` and reclaims GPIO9 and GPIO10
during `preinit()`.


## [Blinky](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/Blinky)

A blinking LED example. An adaptation of the example [Outline](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/Outline) using GPIO9 and GPIO10.
You can also add the module `CustomVendor.ino` if needed.



## [SFDPHexDump](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils/tree/master/examples/SFDPHexDump)

Probe the Flash for SFDP data.

For information gathering, reads and dumps the SFDP. A standalone Sketch that
doesn't require the SpiFlashUtils library.

An example of using the function `experimental::SPI0Command`.
Reads SPI Flash Data Parameters from Flash and prints a hex dump.

To understand the dump, you will need access to JEDEC documentation. Sometimes,
the SPI Flash vendor's datasheet will explain their SFDP data.

"SFDP" may help distinguish between parts at different revision levels.
